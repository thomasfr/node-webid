Make sure to run this code with the latest unstable version of node.js (tested with v0.5.8).

If you have nvm installed you can simply call nvm sync, nvm install latest, nvm use latest.
You can check which version of node you run with: node -v 

Please make sure to create you SSL keys and put them into the keys dir, like it is described in http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.8/api/tls.html
